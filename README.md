Commit #01 of my #100DaysOfCode journey to improve my ReactJS skills.<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Draft.JS](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js). <br />

For the live version, I used [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).<br />

## Available Scripts

To start the project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
